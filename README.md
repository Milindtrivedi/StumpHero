This app is a cricket-specific application that provides users with details of cricket matches, including team names, match date-time, and venue details. Users can also access team and player information by tapping on list of match, or team name title it will directly take you to the Squad details screen.

Screen 1: Login Screen

Input Required : Username & Password which are as follows, 

  - Username : Milind

I have added this screen in order to demonstrate whole app cycle for swiftUI framework & MVVM architechture.   


Screen 2: Match Details - Dashbaord

The first screen of the app displays the match details, including the team names, match date and time, and venue details. It also contains a navigation button embedded in team title that will redirect you to the team and player information. You can easily access the match details from this screen.

Screen 3: Team Squad - Squad Information

The second screen displays the squads of both teams in the best possible way. You can filter the players to display all, Team A, or Team B players. The captain and wicketkeeper are highlighted by giving shadow of Red for captain, Green for WicketKeeper and Pink if a player is both, for example, if MSDhoni(c & wk) then Sir Dhoni will be highlighted with pink colour shadow. By tapping on each player, an alert will be shown that displays the player's batting order, runs, average, style, strikerate and bowling wicket, economy, average & Style. 


Screen 4: Profile 

This is where the user will be able to make changes to one's profile information such as permissions, name & profile picture. By tapping on Sign out button a popup will be displayed from where the user will be able to logout from the device.
